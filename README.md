## Overview

**Project Title**: Python Chat Network

**Project Description**:

**Project Goals**:

- The server (or peer) listens for connections on an IP address (localhost is okay) and a port number you select
- The client (or peer) connects to an already waiting server (or peer)
- The client (or peer) sends at least one type of request message to the server (or peer)
- The server (or peer) processes the request and sends a response back to the client (or peer)
- The server (or peer) can handle a client disconnecting allowing another client to connect

**Stretch Goal**:
Provide support for two or more clients (or peers) to connect to the server at the same time.
OR
Modify the server or the peer to obtain information from a local file or database in response to a request from the client or another peer.
